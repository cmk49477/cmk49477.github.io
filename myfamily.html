<p> I would be nothing without my family. I have two younger brothers, named Cooper and Canon. My mother, Heather, was born and raised in the Southern states in the USA. My father, Ewan, immigrated here from Scotland in the 1990s. My girlfriend, Lauren, and I have been dating for a year and a half. Below are pictures of me with my mother, me with Lauren, and my family together plus our Scottish aunt and uncle.</p>
