November 27 is a date that changed my life <em>forever.</em> At 1:45 a.m., Sunday, November 27, 2011, my aunt and her unborn child were <strong> murdered. </strong> When I first heard the news, I was overwhelmed: caught between emotional extremes. I was so miserable that I wanted to disappear, yet so furious that I felt like I would explode. But I will never forget how I felt that night looking at a blank page, holding a pen. 
<br><br>The paper no longer seemed blank. Instead, it was full of space for me to fill. I began: <em> “Two lives, one bullet. I see his finger on the trigger, and I’m screaming ‘Don’t pull it!’” </em> It didn’t take long. It seemed as if the pen somehow served as a bridge or a translator between my brain and the outside world, finding all the words that I never could. I filled every line. I found solace. Writing gave me a space I could control. In the months following, writing helped me breathe, feel, and move forward.
<br><br>Whenever I feel overwhelmed, I find paper and pen and let the words make sense of it for me. Now, instead of drowning in negativity, I’ve learned to turn my emotions into words on paper.  Recording feelings while they are raw clarifies and preserves them. Without my writing, I don’t’ know how I would have made it to the place in life where I find myself today. Some say they write to escape, but for me, writing helps me see, remember, and move forward.
