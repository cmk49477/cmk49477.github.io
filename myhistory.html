<p>I was born in St. Thomas Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee on August 19, 1996. Childhood: Because my father is a minister, I moved around a lot when I was growing up. In fact, I had lived in nine houses across six states before I was 12 years old. </p>
<p>Now, I am 20 years old. And I am a sophomore at the University of Georgia. I am very thankful to be at UGA, because I almost wasn't able to come here because of my own choices. </p>
<p>The following descriptive list explains the different cities and states I lived in growing up: </p>
<div style="text-align: left">	
<dl>
  <dt>Nashville, Tennessee</dt>
  <dd>This is where I was born. I lived here as an infant for a number of months while my parents looked for our new home.</dd>
  <dt>St. Louis, Missouri</dt>
  <dd>This is where I lived for the first 3 years of my life, while my father finished his education at Covenant Seminary. While we lived here, my mother turned me into a huge fan of St. Louis Cardinals baseball.</dd>
  <dt>Norfolk, Virginia</dt>
  <dd>This is where my parents and I lived for almost two years, while my dad was working at his first church. I went to a private school while we lived here, and I did not like it. </dd>
  <dt>Chicago, Illinois</dt>
  <dd>This is where I lived for almost 5 years of my childhood, and where most of my earliest memories are from. I made many life-long friends while living here.</dd>
  <dt>Park City, Utah</dt>
  <dd>This is where I lived for a brief year before moving to Atlanta. While we lived here, I learned how to snowboard and saw more snow than I knew existed!</dd>
  <dt>Atlanta, Georgia</dt>
  <dd>This is where I lived for my middle school and high school years. I did most of my growing up while we lived here. I think Atlanta is the greatest city in the world! </dd>
